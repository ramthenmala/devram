## Project Overview
This project uses **Sanity.io** for creating, managing, and storing content, while **Next.js** is used to build a performant and scalable frontend that consumes the content from the Sanity CMS. The application will be able to fetch, display, and manage content from Sanity using the Next.js framework.
